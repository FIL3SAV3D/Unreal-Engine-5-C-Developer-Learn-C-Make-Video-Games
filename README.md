# Unreal-Engine-5-C-Developer-Learn-C-Make-Video-Games
This is a repository with all the game projects that were made during this course a year ago. Course providers are Gamedev.tv at udemy.

**Note: I do not recommend downloading the whole folder because they have not been optimized to download. However do check out the cpp and header files**

The course taught me the basics and intermediates of UE5 and also C++. From chronological order (First to last project) Iâ€™ll summarise the content.

Warehouse wreckage: Taught me how to  navigate the UI of UE5 and create a basic level.

Obstacle Assault: Very simple introduction to C++ with the bare minimum to make functions such as rotating objects.

Crypt Raider: Intermediate level of C++ with Casting, Tracing, Waking physics objects, Pointers, dereferencing, etc.

Toon Tanks: A proper first game with rudimentary enemy logic that tracks the Tank movement to shoot at it. Using all the prior knowledge and more creating the game.

Simple Shooter: Unfortunately I do not have the files anymore due to unknown reasons but it was a simple run and gun shooter. Not that hard, not that easy. Just in the middle.

This course was very fruitful and I am glad this was my introduction to C++ which I had heard was quite hard which was daunting and off putting. 10/10 course, would recommend it to people just starting out in both UE5 and C++.
